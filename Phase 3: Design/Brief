Design Brief: 

ScoreLens is a web-based tool for visualizing student academic performance using interactive graphs. It allows professors to upload Excel-based grade data, which is stored in a SQLite database and visualized using charts. The design follows a modular, three-layer architecture: User Interface, Backend Logic, and Database. 

Key Components: 
- Frontend (HTML, JS): Upload forms, charts, dashboard
- Backend (Python with Flask): Excel file parsing, data validation, APIs
- Database (SQLite): Subject-wise score storage and retrieval

Main Use Cases:
- Professors upload student scores and view class trends
- Students view their grades and visual statistics
- Students submit grade change requests

Design Highlights:
- Modular design ensures maintainability and scalability
- Emphasis on usability for non-technical users
- Supports bar, pie, and line charts via Chart.js or Power BI (needs to be decided)
- Basic error handling for file upload, login, and visualization
- Secure access with planned support for role-based authentication

Limitations:
- No mobile version or real-time collaboration in this phase
- Assumes fixed Excel structure and local/offline deployment
