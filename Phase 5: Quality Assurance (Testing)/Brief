Test Plan Brief
- The Software Test Plan for ScoreLens outlines the structured approach to validate the platformâ€™s functionalities and ensure reliable performance. It includes test cases for:

Key Modules Tested:
- Login Module: Validates user authentication with correct and incorrect credentials.
- File Upload Module: Tests Excel file validation, upload success, and error handling for unsupported formats.
- Visualization Module: Ensures correct generation of bar, line, and pie charts based on uploaded data.
- Grade Management: Verifies upload accuracy, class average calculations, and data storage integrity.
- Role-Based Access: Confirms appropriate permissions for students, professors, and admins.
- Exception Handling: Validates behavior under invalid inputs, failed connections, and data retrieval errors.

Test Methods:
- Manual Testing for UI flows and file operations
- Black-box Testing to validate input/output behavior
- Edge Case Testing for empty files, large data, and unexpected formats

Goals:
- Ensure system reliability, security, and usability
- Validate that core functions (login, upload, visualize) work across user roles
- Detect and log bugs before deployment
